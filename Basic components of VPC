Virtual private cloud (VPC) ?
 A virtual isolated network dedicated to your AWS account. 
 
Subnet ?
  A range of IP addresses in your VPC. 
 
Route table ?
  A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. 
  
Internet gateway ? 
   A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet. 
   
VPC endpoint ?
  Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.   
  
Public Subnet ?
  A public subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway. This connects the VPC to the Internet and to other AWS services.   
  
Private Subnet ?
  A private subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that doesn’t have a route to an internet gateway. Instances in the private subnet are backend servers they don’t accept the traffic from the internet.   
  
 Why Public Subnet ?
   The resources in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet and vice versa. For example web server needs to be accessed by users from the internet.   
   
 Why Private Subnet ?
   Resources like database may require connection to internet for updates/patches but should not be accepting request from the internet. In such cases a private subnet is to be used.
